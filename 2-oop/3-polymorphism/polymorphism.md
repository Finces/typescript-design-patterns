# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for a general class of actions, with the specific action determined by the exact nature of the situation or object involved.

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though the method name remains the same.  

## Benefits of polymorphism

- **Code Reusability**: polymorphism allows you to write more generic and reusable code
- **Extensibility**: new classes can be added with minimal changes to existing code
- **Maintenance**: it reduces the complexity of the code by allowing the same method to operate on different types of objects
