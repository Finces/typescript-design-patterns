# Inheritance

inheritance is a principle that allows a new class (called a subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or parent class). This means that the subclass can reuse code from the superclass, reducing redundancy and promoting code reuse.

## Key Points about Inheritance

- **Reusability**: inheritance allows for the reuse of code by allowing new classes to inherit common functionality from existing classes. This reduces the need to rewrite code
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: inheritance creates a natural hierarchy between classes. The subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. For example, if Animal is a superclass, Dog and Cat could be subclasses that inherit from Animal
- **Overriding**: subclasses can modify or override methods inherited from the superclass to provide specific functionality. This allows subclasses to maintain the same interface as the superclass while altering the behavior
- **Extensibility**: inheritance makes it easy to add new functionality by extending existing classes. New methods or properties can be added to the subclass without affecting the superclass
