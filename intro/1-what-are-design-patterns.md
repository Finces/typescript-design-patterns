# What are design patterns

>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design

---

Patterns provide a template or structure for solving certain types of problems, making it easier for developers to write maintainable and efficient code.  

In the context of OOP in TypeScript, design patterns can help address challenges such as creating complex objects, managing the relationships between objects, or ensuring that objects adhere to specific behaviors. 

## Why should we use design patters:  

- **Reusability**  
Design patterns provide tried-and-tested solutions to common problems, reducing the time and effort needed to solve them from scratch. They promote reusability and modularity in software systems.  

- **Improved communication**  
Design patterns provide a shared vocabulary and understanding among developers, enabling more efficient communication about design decisions and solutions.

- **Best practices**  
Design patterns encapsulate the best practices of experienced software developers, allowing novices to learn from their expertise.  

- **Maintainability**  
Implementing design patterns often results in more maintainable code, making it easier to update, debug, and extend in the future.  

- **Easier problem-solving**  
Design patterns provide a structured approach to problem-solving, which can help developers break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components.
