# Design patterns classification

## Creational design patterns

Creational design patterns are focused on the process of object creation. They abstract the instantiation process and help make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. These patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using the new operator. This allows for more flexibility when deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

Examples:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural design patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with the composition of classes and objects. They help in forming large structures using classes and objects, while also ensuring that the structures are scalable, efficient, and maintainable. These patterns focus on simplifying the design by identifying the relationships between entities and organizing them to form a cohesive structure. Structural design patterns facilitate the design of software by enabling the composition of interfaces or implementations.  

Examples:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are responsible for efficient communication and the assignment of responsibilities among objects. They focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other, as well as how the flow of control is organized within a system. These patterns define the protocols for communication between objects and help in distributing responsibilities to ensure that the system is efficient, maintainable, and scalable. By promoting loose coupling and separation of concerns, behavioral design patterns increase the flexibility and adaptability of a software system.

Examples:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
